        "The stock market is highly dynamic and volatile, making accurate predictions of stock prices a significant challenge. This project focuses on analyzing the monthly stock price data of Yes Bank since its inception. The dataset includes key variables such as the monthly opening, highest, lowest, and closing stock prices. The main objective of this project is to predict the monthly closing price of Yes Bank stock using historical data and to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in making such predictions.\n",

        "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the trends and patterns in Yes Bank’s stock prices over the years.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature engineering to select and preprocess relevant features for the model.\n",

        "Accurate stock price prediction is crucial for investors, financial analysts, and stakeholders to make informed decisions in the stock market. Yes Bank, a prominent Indian private sector bank, has experienced significant fluctuations in its stock prices over the years due to various internal and external factors. Understanding these trends and forecasting the monthly closing prices can help in making strategic investment decisions, risk management, and optimizing portfolio performance. By leveraging historical data and advanced predictive models, this project aims to enhance decision-making capabilities for both short-term and long-term investors in the financial market."
