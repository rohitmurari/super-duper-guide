The stock market is highly dynamic and volatile, making accurate predictions of stock prices a significant challenge. This project focuses on analyzing the monthly stock price data of Yes Bank since its inception. The dataset includes key variables such as the monthly opening, highest, lowest, and closing stock prices. The main objective of this project is to predict the monthly closing price of Yes Bank stock using historical data and to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models in making such predictions.

To achieve this goal, the project will involve:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the trends and patterns in Yes Bank’s stock prices over the years.

Feature engineering to select and preprocess relevant features for the model. Developing and training at least two predictive models, including:

A traditional machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
A time series-based model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
Comparing the models' performance to determine the best approach for forecasting the stock’s monthly closing price.

This project aims to provide a reliable method for predicting Yes Bank's stock prices, which could aid investors and analysts in making informed decisions.
